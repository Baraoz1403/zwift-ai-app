# Running Training Plans

Principles and structured plans for running. Distilled from published plans
(Hal Higdon's publicly-available programs) and general exercise-physiology
principles for endurance running. Used by the AI when a rider's sport is
"RUNNING" or their goal involves a running race.

## Running vs cycling: key differences for plan generation

- **No power meter**: intensity is controlled by pace (min/km) or heart rate,
  not watts. Use perceived exertion and HR zones (see power-zones-reference.md
  running section).
- **Impact stress**: running causes more musculoskeletal fatigue than cycling.
  Volume increases must be more conservative — no more than 10% per week
  (the "10% rule"). Recovery days are non-negotiable.
- **Cross-training applies**: easy cycling, swimming, or walking on cross-train
  days supports cardiovascular fitness without adding running impact stress.
- **Long run is the anchor**: the weekly long run (done slowly) is the primary
  fitness driver. It should be the highest-priority session of the week.

## Beginner running zones (no power meter)

| Zone | HR % HRmax | Feel | Equivalent to |
|------|-----------|------|---------------|
| Easy | 60–70% | Fully conversational; "could keep going all day" | Z1–Z2 cycling |
| Aerobic | 71–80% | Comfortable but breathing deeper; short sentences OK | Z2–Z3 cycling |
| Tempo | 81–88% | Comfortably hard; "working" | Z3–Z4 cycling |
| Hard/Interval | 89–95% | Difficult to speak; near race effort | Z4–Z5 cycling |

**Default pace for all long runs and easy runs**: Easy zone (60–70% HRmax).
Running "too fast" on easy days is the #1 beginner mistake.

## 5K Training Plan — Novice (8 weeks)
*Source: Hal Higdon's 5K Novice Program*

**Target rider**: New to running; may have jogged occasionally. Can complete
~2.4km (1.5 miles) at a slow jog.

**Structure**: 3 run days + 1 walk day per week.

**Progression**: Distance increases ~10–15% per week; reaches 5K by week 8.

| Week | Tue Run | Thu Run | Sat Run | Sun Walk |
|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1 | 2.4 km | 2.4 km | 2.4 km | 30 min |
| 2 | 2.8 km | 2.4 km | 2.8 km | 35 min |
| 3 | 3.2 km | 2.4 km | 3.2 km | 40 min |
| 4 | 3.6 km | 2.4 km | 3.6 km | 45 min |
| 5 | 4.0 km | 3.2 km | 4.0 km | 50 min |
| 6 | 4.4 km | 3.2 km | 4.4 km | 55 min |
| 7 | 4.8 km | 3.2 km | 4.8 km | 60 min |
| 8 | 4.8 km | 3.2 km | REST | **5K Race** |

**Key principles**:
- All runs at easy conversational pace
- Run/walk is acceptable — run until tired, walk until recovered
- Rest days are crucial; don't skip them

## 10K Training Plan — Novice (8 weeks)
*Source: Hal Higdon's 10K Novice Program*

**Target rider**: Can run 3–5 km without stopping. Some running background.

**Structure**: 3 runs + 2 cross-train days per week.

| Week | Tue Run | Thu Run | Sun Long Run | Cross-train |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | 4.0 km | 3.2 km | 4.8 km | 2×30–40 min easy |
| 2 | 4.0 km | 3.2 km | 5.6 km | 2×30–40 min easy |
| 3 | 4.0 km | 3.2 km | 6.4 km | 2×35–50 min easy |
| 4 | 4.8 km | 3.2 km | 6.4 km | 2×35–50 min easy |
| 5 | 4.8 km | 3.2 km | 7.3 km | 2×40–60 min easy |
| 6 | 4.8 km | 3.2 km | 8.1 km | 2×40–60 min easy |
| 7 | 4.8 km | 3.2 km | 8.9 km | 2×45–60 min easy |
| 8 | 4.8 km | 3.2 km | REST | **10K Race** |

**Key principles**:
- Sunday long run: slow! 60–90 seconds per km slower than you think you should.
- Cross-training = easy cycling on Zwift (Z1–Z2) is perfect
- Never increase both distance AND intensity in the same week

## Half Marathon Training Plan — Novice (12 weeks)
*Source: Hal Higdon's Half Marathon Novice 1 Program*

**Structure**: 4 runs + cross-training. Long run on Sunday (building to 16 km by week 11).

| Week | Tue Run | Thu Run | Sun Long Run | Key Note |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | 4.8 km | 4.8 km | 6.4 km | Build base |
| 2 | 4.8 km | 4.8 km | 6.4 km | Repeat week 1 |
| 3 | 5.6 km | 5.6 km | 8.1 km | First step-up |
| 4 | 5.9 km | 5.9 km | 8.1 km | Consolidate |
| 5 | 6.4 km | 6.4 km | 9.7 km | Build continues |
| 6 | 6.4 km | 6.4 km | **5K Race** | Mid-plan check |
| 7 | 7.3 km | 7.3 km | 11.3 km | Resume building |
| 8 | 7.3 km | 7.3 km | 12.9 km | Peak-phase begins |
| 9 | 8.1 km | 8.1 km | **10K Race** | Second check |
| 10 | 8.1 km | 8.1 km | 14.5 km | Big week |
| 11 | 8.1 km | 8.1 km | 16.1 km | Longest long run |
| 12 | 6.4 km | 3.2 km | **Half Marathon** | Taper week |

## Adapting running plans to the Zwift AI context

When a rider has running in their goal or history:
- **Treat cross-training days as Zwift riding sessions** — they slot in
  perfectly as Foundation (Z2) rides.
- **Don't mix hard cycling days with hard run days** — if running tempo Tuesday,
  Zwift session should be easy Foundation or Recovery.
- **Running is higher injury risk than cycling** — if the rider shows high
  training load, reduce run volume before cycling volume.
- **Long run day = no Zwift riding** — the long run is the primary stress of
  the week; don't add a cycling session on the same day.

## Common running beginner mistakes to flag in AI insights

1. Running all easy runs too fast (most common error)
2. Skipping rest days because "I feel fine"
3. Increasing weekly mileage by >10% ("too much, too soon" — injury cause #1)
4. Ignoring cross-training days (cycling cross-train reduces injury risk)
5. Trying to run through pain (especially knee/shin — signal to stop, not push)
